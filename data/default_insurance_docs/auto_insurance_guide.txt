AUTO INSURANCE - COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE

================================================================================
SECTION 1: AUTO INSURANCE BASICS
================================================================================

What is Auto Insurance?

Auto insurance is a contract between you and an insurance company that protects you against financial loss in case of an accident or theft. In exchange for premium payments, the insurance company agrees to pay for covered losses as outlined in your policy.

Why It's Required:

Nearly every state requires drivers to carry minimum auto insurance coverage. Requirements vary by state, but typically include liability coverage to protect others if you cause an accident. Driving without insurance can result in:
- Fines of $500-$5,000
- License suspension
- Vehicle impoundment
- Personal liability for damages

================================================================================
SECTION 2: TYPES OF AUTO COVERAGE
================================================================================

Liability Coverage (Required in Most States)

Bodily Injury Liability (BI):
Covers medical expenses, lost wages, and legal fees if you injure someone in an accident you caused.

Common limits: 25/50, 50/100, 100/300, 250/500
Format: $XXX per person / $XXX per accident

Examples:
- 25/50: $25,000 per person, $50,000 per accident
- 100/300: $100,000 per person, $300,000 per accident

Property Damage Liability (PD):
Covers damage to other people's property (vehicles, buildings, fences, etc.) if you're at fault.

Common limits: $10,000, $25,000, $50,000, $100,000

Full Liability Example: 100/300/50
- $100,000 bodily injury per person
- $300,000 bodily injury per accident
- $50,000 property damage per accident

Collision Coverage (Optional but Often Required by Lenders)

Covers damage to YOUR vehicle from:
- Collisions with other vehicles
- Single-car accidents
- Hitting objects (poles, trees, guardrails)
- Rolling your vehicle

Deductibles: $250, $500, $1,000, $2,000
Example: Car repair costs $5,000, deductible $1,000 → you pay $1,000, insurance pays $4,000

Comprehensive Coverage (Optional)

Covers damage to YOUR vehicle from non-collision events:
- Theft or attempted theft
- Vandalism
- Fire and explosions
- Natural disasters (hurricanes, tornadoes, hail)
- Falling objects (trees, rocks)
- Animal collisions (deer, etc.)
- Glass breakage
- Civil disturbances and riots

Deductibles: Usually $250-$1,000

Personal Injury Protection (PIP) - Required in No-Fault States

Covers medical expenses for you and passengers regardless of fault:
- Medical bills
- Rehabilitation costs
- Lost wages
- Funeral expenses
- Essential services (childcare, housekeeping)

Limits: $2,500 to $50,000 or more
Required in: Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Utah

Medical Payments Coverage (MedPay)

Similar to PIP but simpler. Covers medical expenses for you and passengers regardless of fault. Does NOT cover lost wages or other expenses like PIP.

Common limits: $1,000, $2,000, $5,000, $10,000

Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage (UM/UIM)

Protects you if hit by a driver with no insurance or insufficient coverage:

Uninsured Motorist (UM):
- Covers injuries when at-fault driver has no insurance
- Covers hit-and-run accidents

Underinsured Motorist (UIM):
- Covers injuries when at-fault driver's limits are too low
- Pays the difference between their coverage and your damages

Limits mirror your liability limits (e.g., 100/300)

Rental Reimbursement Coverage

Pays for rental car while your vehicle is being repaired after a covered claim.

Typical coverage: $30-$50 per day for 30 days
Total limit: $900-$1,500

Roadside Assistance / Towing Coverage

Covers emergency services:
- Towing to nearest repair shop
- Jump-starts
- Flat tire changes
- Locksmith services
- Fuel delivery
- Winching/extraction

Typical limit: $50-$100 per incident

Gap Insurance

Covers the "gap" between what you owe on your car loan and the car's actual cash value if totaled.

Example:
- You owe: $25,000 on loan
- Car's value: $20,000
- Gap coverage pays: $5,000 difference

Essential for:
- New cars (high depreciation)
- Long-term loans (5-7 years)
- Low down payments

================================================================================

================================================================================
SECTION 4: COVERAGE SCENARIOS AND EXAMPLES
================================================================================

Scenario 1: You Cause an Accident

You rear-end another car. The other driver has $15,000 in medical bills and their car requires $8,000 in repairs.

Your coverage: 50/100/50 liability
Insurance pays:
- Bodily injury: $15,000 (under your $50,000 limit)
- Property damage: $8,000 (under your $50,000 limit)
- Your out-of-pocket: $0 (within limits)

Your deductible: N/A (deductible only applies to YOUR vehicle damage)

Scenario 2: Hit by Uninsured Driver

An uninsured driver runs a red light and hits you. You have $20,000 in medical bills.

Your coverage: 100/300 uninsured motorist
Insurance pays: $20,000 for your medical bills
Your out-of-pocket: $0

Without UM coverage: You'd sue the at-fault driver personally (often uncollectible)

Scenario 3: Comprehensive Claim - Hail Damage

Hailstorm damages your car's hood, roof, and windows. Repair estimate: $6,500.

Your coverage: Comprehensive with $500 deductible
Insurance pays: $6,000
Your out-of-pocket: $500 (your deductible)

This is NOT an at-fault claim and won't raise your rates.

Scenario 4: Total Loss

You're in an accident and your car is totaled.

Car's actual cash value: $18,000
Your loan balance: $22,000

Without gap insurance:
- Insurance pays: $18,000
- You still owe: $4,000

With gap insurance:
- Insurance pays: $18,000 (ACV)
- Gap pays: $4,000 (difference)
