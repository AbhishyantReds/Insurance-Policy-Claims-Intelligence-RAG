3. Conditions: Your obligations and the insurer's obligations
4. Exclusions: What is NOT covered
5. Definitions: Specific meanings of policy terms

Tips for Reading Your Policy:

- Read the entire policy, not just the summary
- Pay special attention to exclusions
- Understand your deductibles and limits
- Know your duties after a loss
- Ask questions about anything unclear
- Review annually as circumstances change

Remember: Insurance is a contract. Understanding these terms helps you make informed decisions about your coverage and successfully navigate the claims process when needed.
