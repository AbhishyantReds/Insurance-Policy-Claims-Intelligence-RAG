MOTOR INSURANCE - COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE (INDIA)

================================================================================
SECTION 1: MOTOR INSURANCE BASICS
================================================================================

What is Motor Insurance?

Motor insurance is a contract between you and an insurance company that protects you against financial loss in case of an accident, theft, or damage to your vehicle. In exchange for premium payments, the insurance company agrees to pay for covered losses as outlined in your policy.

Why It's Required in India:

As per the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, third-party motor insurance is mandatory in India. Driving without valid insurance can result in:
- Fines of ₹2,000 for first offence
- Fines of ₹4,000 for subsequent offences
- Imprisonment up to 3 months
- Vehicle impoundment
- Personal liability for damages

Regulatory Body: Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)
