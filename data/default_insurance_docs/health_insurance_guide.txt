HEALTH INSURANCE - COMPLETE GUIDE

================================================================================
SECTION 1: HEALTH INSURANCE FUNDAMENTALS
================================================================================

What is Health Insurance?

Health insurance is coverage that pays for medical, surgical, and prescription drug expenses. It can reimburse you for expenses incurred from illness or injury, or pay the care provider directly. Health insurance helps protect you from unexpected, high medical costs.

Why You Need It:

Medical costs in the United States are extremely high. A single hospital stay can cost $10,000-$50,000+. Major surgeries can exceed $100,000. Without insurance, medical debt is the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in America.

The Affordable Care Act (ACA):

Requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty (federal penalty eliminated in 2019, but some states still have mandates). Established protections including:
- Cannot deny coverage for pre-existing conditions
- Cannot charge more for pre-existing conditions
- Cannot drop coverage when you get sick
- Preventive care must be free
- Children can stay on parents' plan until age 26

================================================================================

Premium:
Monthly payment to maintain coverage. Must be paid regardless of whether you use healthcare services.

Average monthly premiums (2026):
- Individual: $450-$600
- Family: $1,200-$1,600

Deductible:
Amount you pay before insurance starts paying. Resets annually.

Common deductibles:
- Low: $500-$1,500

Coinsurance:

================================================================================
SECTION 10: TIPS FOR CHOOSING HEALTH INSURANCE
================================================================================

Consider Your Healthcare Needs:

Low Healthcare Use (Healthy, Young):
- High deductible plan with HSA
- Catastrophic plan (if under 30)
- Lower premiums worth the risk

Moderate Healthcare Use:
- PPO or EPO
- Balanced premiums and out-of-pocket costs
- Consider copays for regular doctor visits

High Healthcare Use (Chronic Conditions, Medications):
- HMO or low-deductible plan
- Higher premiums offset by lower out-of-pocket costs
- Consider prescription drug coverage

Questions to Ask:

1. Are my doctors in-network?
2. Are my medications covered? What tier?
3. What's the total potential cost (premium + max out-of-pocket)?
4. Are there copays before deductible?
5. What's covered for preventive care?
6. Do I need referrals for specialists?
7. What's the prescription formulary?
8. Are there network restrictions?

Calculate Total Potential Cost:

Best Case (No Major Issues):
Annual premium + routine care copays

Worst Case (Major Medical Event):
Annual premium + out-of-pocket maximum

Example Comparison:

Plan A (Low Premium, High Deductible):
- Premium: $300/month = $3,600/year
- Deductible: $5,000
- Out-of-pocket max: $8,000
- Best case: $3,600
- Worst case: $11,600

Plan B (High Premium, Low Deductible):
- Premium: $500/month = $6,000/year
- Deductible: $1,000
- Out-of-pocket max: $5,000
- Best case: $6,000
- Worst case: $11,000

If you're healthy: Plan A saves $2,400/year
If you have major medical event: Plans are similar

Red Flags:

- "Too good to be true" plans
- Short-term health plans (not ACA-compliant)
- Health sharing ministries (not insurance)
- Plans with annual or lifetime limits
- Plans excluding pre-existing conditions (illegal under ACA for major medical)

Resources:

- Healthcare.gov (federal marketplace)
- State insurance marketplace websites
- Medicare.gov (65+)
- Medicaid.gov (low income)
- Insurance broker or agent

Average Annual Healthcare Costs (2026):
- Individual: $7,000-$12,000 (premium + out-of-pocket)
- Family: $20,000-$30,000 (premium + out-of-pocket)

Remember: Health insurance is complex. Take time to understand your options, ask questions, and choose coverage that fits your health needs and budget. The cheapest plan isn't always the best value.
