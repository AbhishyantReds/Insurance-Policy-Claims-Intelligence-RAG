RENTERS INSURANCE - COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE (INDIA)

================================================================================
SECTION 1: RENTERS INSURANCE BASICS
================================================================================

What is Renters Insurance?

Renters insurance (also called tenant's insurance) protects your personal belongings and provides liability coverage when you're living in a rented property. It covers your possessions, not the building structure, which is the landlord's responsibility.

Regulatory Body: Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI)

Why Renters Need Insurance:

- Your landlord's policy doesn't cover YOUR belongings
- Protection against theft in rented premises
- Fire can destroy all your possessions
- Natural disasters like floods and earthquakes
- Liability protection if someone is injured
- Required by some premium landlords

Common Misconception:
"My landlord has insurance, so I'm covered" - FALSE
Landlord's insurance only covers the building structure, not your personal items.

Renters Insurance Penetration in India: Less than 1%
Growing awareness in metros among young professionals
