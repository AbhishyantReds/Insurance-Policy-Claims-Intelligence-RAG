HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE - COMPLETE GUIDE

================================================================================
SECTION 1: OVERVIEW
================================================================================

What is Homeowners Insurance?

Homeowners insurance is a type of property insurance that provides financial protection for your home and belongings. It covers damage to your property and liability for injuries that occur on your property. A standard homeowners insurance policy protects both the structure of your home and your personal possessions.

Why You Need It:

Most mortgage lenders require homeowners insurance as a condition of the loan. Even if you own your home outright, insurance protects your largest financial investment from unexpected losses due to fire, theft, weather damage, and other covered perils.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: STANDARD COVERAGE TYPES
================================================================================

Coverage A - Dwelling Coverage:
Protects the structure of your home including walls, roof, floors, built-in appliances, and attached structures like garages. Typical coverage limits range from $200,000 to $500,000 depending on home value. Does NOT cover land value.

Coverage B - Other Structures:
Covers detached structures on your property such as:
- Detached garages
- Sheds and tool houses
- Fences and gates
- Swimming pools
- Gazebos and pergolas

Usually set at 10% of dwelling coverage amount.

Coverage C - Personal Property:
Protects your belongings including furniture, clothing, electronics, appliances, and other personal items. Standard coverage is typically 50-70% of dwelling coverage. For example, if dwelling coverage is $300,000, personal property coverage would be $150,000-$210,000.

Special limits apply to:
- Jewelry and watches: $1,500-$2,500

Typically 20-30% of dwelling coverage, usually for 12-24 months.

SECTION 3: COMMON DEDUCTIBLES
================================================================================

Standard Deductibles:

A deductible is the amount you pay out-of-pocket before insurance coverage kicks in. Common deductible amounts:

- $500: Lower deductible, higher premium
- $1,000: Most common choice, balanced cost
- $2,500: Higher deductible, lower premium
- $5,000: Highest deductible, lowest premium

Percentage Deductibles:

Some policies use percentage deductibles, especially for wind and hail damage:
- 1% of dwelling coverage
- 2% of dwelling coverage (most common)
- 5% of dwelling coverage (hurricane-prone areas)

Example: $300,000 home with 2% deductible = $6,000 out-of-pocket
